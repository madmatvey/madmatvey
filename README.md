# Hi there! 👋 I'm Eugene Leontev

I'm a self-made Ruby Backend Developer and team leader with over 8 years of experience building highly loaded backends for mobile, web, and distributed applications. My main technology stack includes Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and Amazon AWS. I thrive in startups and mid-sized companies, solving real problems, taking ownership of products, and bringing measurable value to users.

I believe in simplicity, transparency, and measurability. My approach to complex systems is to build them in small, simple iterations. I'm an advocate of clean architecture and SOLID principles, and I ensure everything works as expected by covering source code with unit tests.
